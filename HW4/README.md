# Simplified Scriptable Instruction Level Debugger
You have to implement a simple instruction-level debugger that allows a user to debug a program interactively at the assembly instruction level.
You can implement the debugger by using the ptrace interface. 
The commands you have to implement are summarized as follows:

```
- break {instruction-address}: add a break point
- cont: continue execution
- delete {break-point-id}: remove a break point
- disasm addr: disassemble instructions in a file or a memory region
- dump addr: dump memory content
- exit: terminate the debugger
- get reg: get a single value from a register
- getregs: show registers
- help: show this message
- list: list break points
- load {path/to/a/program}: load a program
- run: run the program
- vmmap: show memory layout
- set reg val: get a single value to a register
- si: step into instruction
- start: start the program and stop at the first instruction
```

In a debugging process, you have to load a program first, 
configure the debugger, and start debugging by running the program. 
A debugger command may be only used in certain "states." 
The states include **any**, **not loaded**, **loaded**, and **running**. 
- State **any** means that a command can be used at any time. 
- State **not loaded** means that a command can only be used when a program is not loaded. 
- State **loaded** means that a command can only be used when a program is loaded. 
- State **running** means that a command can only be used when the program is running. 
- The following is the state flow chart:

## Details
The details of each command are explained below. We use brackets right after a command to enclose the list of the state(s) that the command should support.

- **break** or **b** ==[running]==: Setup a break point. If a program is loaded but is not running, you can simply display an error message. When a break point is hit, you have to output a message and indicate the corresponding address and instruction. The address of the break point should be within the range specified by the text segment in the ELF file and will not be the same as the entry point.
- cont or c [running]: continue the execution when a running program is stopped (suspended).
- delete [running]: remove a break point. Please remember to handle illegal situations, like deleting non-existing break points.
- disasm or d [running]: Disassemble instructions in a file or a memory region. The address of each instruction should be within the range specified by the text segment in the ELF file. You only have to dump 10 instructions for each command. If disasm command is executed without an address, you can simply output ** no addr is given. Please note that the output should not have the machine code cc. See the demonstration section for the sample output format.
- dump or x [running]: Dump memory content. You only have to dump 80 bytes from a given address. The output contains the addresses, the hex values, and printable ASCII characters. If dump command is executed without an address, you can simply output ** no addr is given. Please note that the output should include the machine code cc if there is a break point.
- exit or q [any]: Quit from the debugger. The program being debugged should be killed as well.
- get or g [running]: Get the value of a register. Register names are all in lowercase.
- getregs [running]: Get the value of all registers.
- help or h [any]: Show the help message.
- list or l [any]: List break points, which contains index numbers (for deletion) and addresses.
- load [not loaded]: Load a program into the debugger. When a program is loaded, you have to print out the address of entry point.
- run or r [loaded and running]: Run the program. If the program is already running, show a warning message and continue the execution. If the program is loaded, start the program and continue the execution.
- vmmap or m [running]: Show memory layout for a running program. If a program is not running, you can simply display an error message. The memory layout is:
[address] [perms] [offset] [pathname]
Check the demonstration section for the sample output format.
- set or s [running]: Set the value of a register
- si [running]: Run a single instruction, and step into function calls.
- start [loaded]: Start the program and stop at the first instruction.
